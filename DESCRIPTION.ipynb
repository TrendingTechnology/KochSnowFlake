    "# Koch Snowflake\n",
    "\n",
    "The Koch snowflake is a fractal curve and one of the earliest fractals to have been described.\n",
    "\n",
    "for constructing this fractal human should follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. divide the line segment into three segments of equal length.\n",
    "2. draw an equilateral triangle that has the middle segment from step 1 as its base and points outward.\n",
    "3. remove the line segment that is the base of the triangle from step 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "however, computers need a much more specific and accurate algorithm to generate this mathematic beauty, therefore i am going to explain how does my algorithm work.\n",
